# Graphs-Project




This graph project encompasses various graph algorithms such as breadth-first search (BFS), A* search, and other pathfinding algorithms to navigate through vertices and construct paths efficiently. The system is designed to find the most cost-effective route from point A to point B on the toll roads of Chicago, optimizing for the lowest overall toll expenses for a vacation trip. While ensuring that there are enough funds to cover toll expenses, the primary aim is to save money for indulging in delicious Chicago-style pizza. The final function in this project analyzes the graph data, calculates the toll costs along potential routes, and determines the route with the cheapest toll expenses, providing an ideal itinerary for a budget-friendly yet enjoyable vacation in Chicago.
